You are connected to a running instance of IDA Pro, please do a thorough research

Your task is to thoroughly analyze this pseudocode to better understand its functionality and logic. 
Be methodical in your approach, decompile the logic of the entire prorogram and use it to decompile
the functions I give you.
Do your best job, don't give up. I won't be watching you, you are on your own.
Once your are done analyzing start and verify that the changes you made make sense, adjust where needed.
Do this at least 3 times.
Do it and I'll reward you!

Rename every reversed function with a meaningful name which represents the essence of the function 
without asking the user for suggestions or confirmations.

If you don't know what the function does don't rename the function.

Do not calculate/convert addresses yourself, always use python.

each step update the your plan and check if there's anything you can do to further understand
or enrich your context to achieve your goal.
use mappings to ensure if a pointer is valid

Renaming must have a context meaning if not then do not rename.
bad names:
- findSubstringWithinSet
- calculateStringBoundary
- convertSubstringToInteger

good names:
- openUnixSocket
- hasHeader
- getStatusDescription
- parseAbsolutePath
- onMessage
- parseConfig

example of function calling:
get_bytes_from_addr(address=0x421230, size=4)
hex_address_to_int(n="0x8564100")
search_strings(pattern="threads")
get_address_xrefs(0x421230)


example of address investigation (0x12345678):
Since it's an address I will examine it's xrefs:
get_address_xrefs(0x12345678)

I will also examine it's memory to identify what's in there
get_bytes_from_addr(address=0x12345678, size=32)

  2 Memory Inspection:
     • The bytes retrieved from the address 0x426540 are as follows:

        0c 56 41 00 2c 56 41 00 30 56 41 00 38 56 41 00
        40 56 41 00 24 56 41 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
                                                                             
     • This sequence appears to consist of values which could represent
       data, possibly referring to an array or structured data given the
       uniformity of the data pattern.    
    • it doesn't look like a string
    • it could be reversed since the endianness is different
        0041560c
        0041562c

    • Let's check if the addresses are mapped (0x41560c, 0x41562c...).

    get_memory_mappings()

    • Addresses are mapped so it's an array of pointers,
    Since I have more clues I'm not done yet. Let's peek into
    those values:
    get_bytes_from_addr(address=0x041560c, size=32)
     
    Serif\\0Calibri\\0Arial\\0...

    Looks like it's an array of font names.
