## Changelog and thinking notes
- Added type hints and docstrings
- With examples, the LLM able to investigate array of strings/pointers further
- Agent is able to understand functionality of a function based on the usage of it (going up in call-graph) (with direct instruction).


#### Thoughts:
- Team agents might be needed to validate and evaluate results of the agent like naming, assumptions, 
    help the main agent get further and refine results.
- 

#### Tasks:
1. Add call graph flow
2. Give the agent access to api docs (webtool/knowledgebase)
