MVP:
Goal: reversing one function at a time, agentic.
1. Tools for navigating the binary in ida.
    1.2. Python class including tools of ida (**get xrefs** (usages or mentioning), **get_function_decompile**, search strings, search memory, search function, **get_call_graph** , etc..)
2. Fine tuned gpt4 (nice to have)

Evaluation:
1. Evaluate results against qwen-coder and finetuned mistral

Next iteration:
1. gpt4 fine tune
2. Offline model gpt4.5 similar results
    2.1 integrate the model for offline use (should be better than qwen2.5)
4. Give chat context abilities with the right tooling.

Next iteration:
5. Full binary analysis


Ideal:
1. Chat with binary, ask for sources and sinks, behavior of the binary, modules, handling etc..
2. Search for code patterns (RAG all decompiled code) (CodeQL)
3. Link dynamic calls and their vtables.

Issues:
1. Big functions
2. context functions

Strategies (Single function):

1. **Provide xref usages** (Tool) - (also write a guide and examples of exploring xrefs)
2. if you dont know do not rename binaries
3. **Call graph** - get extensive call graph (backward and foreward)
4. Scan the binary in overall to give the model a little bit of context
5. Researcher guided exploration. (chat)
6. improve tools
    6.1. return objects as results (like memory, arrays, etc)
            to help with understanding the results. (or ask the user)
7. Team agents - correction agent + feedback agent / Researcher aided-feedback
    7.1 evaluation & validation agent.
8. Divide prompts based on the techniques, create worker agent for that.
    8.1. RAG those prompts? (to help the tool learn the right techniques) (temporary solution since fine tuning is preferred)
9. Give the agent access to api docs (webtool/knowledgebase)
10. Extract useful information about the binary/PDB + user information + Docs and RAG it. Then the agent is able
    to navigate the binary better.
11. Use Agno workflow to struct flows for exploring/research (exploring addresses, functions, globals, strings etc.., im not sure what else)
12. Main agent generates research questions which other agents try to answer each with a different responsibility

Full binary:
4. **Bottom-up**? Up-bottom?
5. Start with the top 5 most called functions
6. Start with libc functions xrefs as seeds (small functions that we might be able to reverse easily, functions without no context)
7. Start with stringed functions? it will make it easier to reverse the binary in overall
8. start with inputs like reading files, recv, send then loop up the call flow (taint analysis).

Features:
9. Read cves and try to match them or their patch in the binary
10. infer symbols from source code
11. match source code to binary

Similar ideas:
1. RAG Docs
2. Codeql for decompiled code. indexing decompiled code.


MultiAgents:
1. Flow tracer
    1.  Trace from Source to Sink - “Does input from socket ever reach strcpy?”
    2.  Trace Callers or Paths to a Function -  “Show me all call paths leading to decrypt_buffer()”
    3. Taint Analysis / Data Provenance -  “Track all changes to arg_4 in function X and any aliases in callees.”
    4. Forward Reachability Analysis (Coloring) -  “Which functions can be reached directly or indirectly from network-facing code?” 
        (color all reachable code)
    5. Track the Lifetime of an Argument / Variable - “Trace the lifetime of a1 from entry to exit.”
    6. Trace vtables or function pointer tables to see where dynamic calls may go.
    7. Trace Field Usage in Structs

    Examples:
    1. “Are the inputs to do_important_thing() ever attacker-controlled?”
    2. Analyze how a pointer gets dereferenced and whether it could be attacker-controlled.
